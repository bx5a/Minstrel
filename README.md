# Minstrel

## The idea
__Minstrel__ is an Android audio player targeting the particular use of parties. 
During those occasions, you usually find yourself switching between youtube, spotify or any other streaming service. This application aims at making it easy to create a playlist using songs from any source.

## Install
__Minstrel__ is built using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). To try it you just have to create a new project from version control. 

_Please note_ that this application requires that the YouTube application is installed. To work on a virtual device, you can download the app from [apkmirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/?s=youtube&post_type=apps_post) and install it using these [instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3480201/how-do-you-install-an-apk-file-in-the-android-emulator)

## Contribute
I'd be more than happy to listen to any suggestion from users or to accept pull requests. Feel free to fill an [issue](https://github.com/bx5a/Minstrel/issues) if you have troubles using the app or an idea to improve it.
